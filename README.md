my homework number 5
This repository was create for my homwork 5:

1. Create three-dimensional array integers. Using loops, go through the entire array and increase each element for a given number. Let the number that will be increase each element, set from the console.
2. Create a program to color a chessboard using a loop. Create a two-dimensional 8x8 array of Strings. Using loops to set cycle elements have the values B(Black) or W(White).

Additional homework

3. Multiplying two matrices. Create two 3x3 arrays of integers (two matrices). Write a program to multiply two matrices.

   First array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}};
   Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}};
   Expected result: 1 2 3 1 1 1 0 0 0

5. Create a two-dimensional array of integers. Print the amount to the console all elements of the array.
6. Create a two-dimensional array. Print array diagonals to console.
7. Create a two-dimensional array of integers. Sort the elements into rows of a two-dimensional array in ascending order.
